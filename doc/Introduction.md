# Introduction
Nowadays, it is popular for a computer to have more than 2 cores in a processor. The advantage of having multiple cores is to distribute the work load and tasks which is not only enhance the speed performance of computer but also improve user's experience. Since 1960s, people started to experiment to build computer with multiple processors. The first super computer which combines multiple processors in order to solve complex problem is  [ILLIAC IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILLIAC_IV), and it appeared in the 1970s. The partial success of it leads to the booming of parallel architecture for supercomputer.Therefore, people has to come up with the way to program multiprocessing computer to take advantage of parallelism computer architecture.
